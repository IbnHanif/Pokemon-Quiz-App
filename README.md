# Pokemon Quiz App ⚡🎮

A simple, interactive Pokémon-themed quiz web app built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
It tests your Pokédex knowledge through multiple-choice questions with a live score counter and progress bar.

This project was made as a learning exercise while practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering in JavaScript.

## 🧠 How It Works

* Questions are stored in a JavaScript array (`quizQuestions`)
* Each question contains:

  * The question text
  * Multiple answers
  * Which answer is correct
* When the quiz starts:

  * The Start screen hides
  * The Quiz screen shows
  * Questions and answers are loaded dynamically
* When you select an answer:

  * Correct/incorrect styles are applied
  * Score increases if the answer is correct
* After the last question:

  * The Result screen shows your final Poké-Points

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add more questions (Gen 1–Gen 9)
* Add Pokémon images for each question
* Add sound effects
* Add difficulty levels
* Save high scores using Local Storage
* Add a timer for each question
